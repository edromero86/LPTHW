Designing and Debugging 

Rules for if statements:

1. Every if statement must have an else. 

2. Never nest if statements more than two deep and always try do do them on deep. 

3. Treat if statements like paragraphs, where each if, elif, else grouping is like a set of
	sentences. Put blank lines before and after. 
	
4. Your boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations to 
	variables earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable. 
	
Rules for Loops: 

1. Use a while loop only to loop forever, and that means probably never. This only applies to
	Python, other languages are different. 
	
2. Use a for loop for all other kinds of looping, especially if there is a fixed ot limited
	number if things to loop over. 
	

Tips for debugging: 

1. Do not use a debugger. A debugger is like doing a full body scan on a sick person. 
	
2. The best way to debug a program is to use a print to print out the values of variables at
	points in the program to see where they go wrong. 
	
3. Make sure parts of your programs work as you work on them. 
	Do not write massive files of code before you try to run them. 
	Code a little, run a little, fix a little.
